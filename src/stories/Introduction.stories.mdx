Hi Miss,

It's a tutorial to use Storybook.

Before, let's me explain the reason that I use this tools to share my work.
In my article, I speak about a new concept in web developement : web components.
With React (the framework that I use), we use this concept everytime.
So I split my all components in a lot of things.
I found this tools useful to show my components in an easy way for you.

Now let's go about tutorial.

You have a sidebar on the website.

import ImageFile from './assets/sidebar.png';

<img src={ImageFile} />

Each entry is a document, you can click one and it change the page.  
If I choose Field without robot, you will see the component Field with all data.

import ImageField from './assets/field.png';

<img src={ImageField} />


There is four components that I do for the project in early January.  
So you can navigate between this few document.

Best regards,
Etienne.
